# Image Features Described in Audio for Accessibility

## Overview
This project aims to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals by generating audio descriptions of image features. Using state-of-the-art image captioning models, the project creates descriptive narratives that are then translated into audio formats for easy comprehension.

## Features
- **Image Captioning**: Automatically generates captions for input images using a Vision-Transformer and GPT-2 model.
- **Multilingual Translation**: Translates English captions into Kannada and Hindi to reach a broader audience.
- **Audio Narration**: Converts text captions into audio, providing an auditory representation of visual content.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple integration allows users to input any image and receive descriptive audio output.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, check out the code.ipynb file for detailed setup and installation instructions.

## Usage

Step 1: Upload Images
üì• Place your images in the appropriate directory (e.g., /content/Images/).

Step 2: Set Image Path
üîó Update the image_path variable in the code to point to your desired image:
image_path = '/content/Images/your_image.jpg'  # Replace with your image filename

Step 3: Generate Descriptions
‚öôÔ∏è Run the code to generate captions, translate them into Kannada and Hindi, and convert them to audio.

Step 4: Play Audio
